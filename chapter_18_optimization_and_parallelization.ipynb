    "This chapter covered **optimization and parallelization** techniques including spatial data structures (BVH, octrees), CPU vectorization with SIMD, multi-threading, GPU programming with CUDA/OpenCL, memory optimization, and profiling. These techniques are essential for achieving real-time performance in games and interactive applications, as well as accelerating offline rendering for film and visualization."
