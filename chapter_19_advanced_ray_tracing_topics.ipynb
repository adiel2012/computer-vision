    "This chapter explored **advanced ray tracing techniques** including bidirectional path tracing for complex light transport, photon mapping for caustics and indirect illumination, progressive and adaptive rendering, real-time ray tracing with hardware acceleration, denoising algorithms, and hybrid rasterization-ray tracing approaches. These methods represent the state-of-the-art in production rendering and are increasingly used in real-time applications with modern GPU ray tracing hardware."
